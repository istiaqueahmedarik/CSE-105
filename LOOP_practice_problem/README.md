Question-8
Take an integer n as input and print i=1n(-1)ni   along with the series. For example if n is 5 then the output will look like: -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 = -3

Question-9
Take an integer n as input and print i=1ni2   along with the series. For example if n is 5 then the output will look like: 1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + 4x4 + 5x5 = 55

Question-10
Take two integers p and q as input and print the sum of the numbers from p to q along with the series. For example if p is 6 and q is 10 then the output will look like: 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 40

Question-11
Take an integer n as input and print the factorial of n along with the series. For example if n is 6 then the output will look like: 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720

Question-12
Take two integers n and r as input and print the value of nCr.For example if n is 7 and r is 3 then the output will be: 35

Question-13
Take an integer n as input and print the value of 2n. For example if n is 7 then the output will be: 128

Question-14
Take two integers m and n as input and print the value of mn. For example if m is 3 and n is 2 then the output will be: 9

Question-15
Take an integer n as input and print “PRIME” if n is a prime number otherwise print “NOT PRIME”. For example if n is 35 then output will be NOT PRIME. If n is 41 then output will be PRIME

Question-16
Take an integer n as input and print all the divisors of n. For example if n is 12 then the output will be: 1 2 3 4 6 12.

Question-17
Take an integer n as input and print all the multiplicative pairs of n into i x j = n format where i <= j. For example if n is 12 then the output will be:
1 x 12 = 12
2 x 6 = 12
3 x 4 = 12

Question-18

Question-19
Take an integer n as input and print the number of zeros in n. For example if n is 6007802 then the output will be: 3

Question-20
You know that the absolute value of the subtraction of a number and the reverse of that number is always divisible by 9. Now take an integer n as input and print the output in the following format:
|n - reverse of n| = 9 x k
 For example if n is 125 then the output will be: |125 - 521| = 9 x 44

Question-21
Take an integer n as input and in the next line take n number of integers as input. Now print the maximum number among all the n integers in the second line. For example consider the following input
8
10  15  12  14  18  9  18  16
You output will be: 18

Question-22
Take an integer n as input and in the next line take n number of integers as input. Now print the maximum number, minimum number, summation and frequency of positive numbers among all the n integers in the second line. For example consider the following input
8
10  0  12  -3  18  9  18  16
You output will be: 
Maxim number: 18, Minimum number: -3, Sum: 80, Frequency of positive numbers: 6

Question-23
Take two integers a and b as input and print the gcd (greatest common divisor) and lcm (least common multiple) of a and b as output. For example if a is 25 and b is 60 then the output will be as following:
GCD: 5, LCM: 300

Question-24
Take an integer n as input and print the n-th fibonacci number as output. For example if n is 9 then the output will be 21.

Question-25
Consider that you have two operations: addition and subtraction. Now you have to make a simple calculator with these two operations. The input of the calculator is given in the following format:
d A B where d, A and B are integers. The value of d decides the type of the operation. If d is 0 then the calculator displays the value of A+B, if the value of d is 1 then the calculator displays the value of A-B. Note that your calculator never shuts down until the user gives any other values except 0 and 1 as d.
For making a beautiful interface, for each case, first print the case number. After that, in the next line the calculator prints “Sum: ” and then prints the value of A+B if d = 0. In case of d=1 the calculator prints “Sub: “ and then prints the value of A-B. Examine the following input output section.
Input
Output
1  5  8
1  2  7
0  7  9
1  4  5
0  5  4

Case 1
Sum: 13

Case 2
Sum: 9

Case 3
Sub: -2

Case 4
Sum: 9

Case 5
Sub: 1
